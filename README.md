My recent pivot to enter the world of web development and UX design came after years of collaborating with designers and developers as a digital marketer. This experience fostered my passion for thinking through online experiences and ways to improve outcomes for both end-users and businesses.

With a background primarily in the nonprofit sector, I am well-versed in environments where flexibility and creativity are important keys in attracting and growing meaningful connections with users. It was while working at a full-service marketing agency that I began formally wireframing and prototyping, further cultivating my interests in analytics, research, and exploring user flow.

I value collaborative company cultures where my impact can be measured and I’m given the opportunity to grow and improve.
